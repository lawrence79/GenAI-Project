GenAI Project

## Goal
To implement an AI-based system that can translate text from one language to another with high accuracy and fluency, while also being able to learn from its mistakes and improve over time. 
Ideally, the system should be able to handle a wide range of languages and dialects, and be scalable to meet the needs of large organizations and businesses.

## Scenario 

FutureTech Innovations has contracted K+C to handle their digital properties. They want to expand their market to different countries and regions, so they need their website to be available in multiple languages.
Future-techâ€™s PM has provided us with an English JSON file of the existing content. The JSON file contains all the text content of the website with some dynamic values displayed using double-curly braces Example: {{data}} . 

The team has the following responsibilities: 

* Translate this file into Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Chinese, Japanese and Arabic.

* Deliver the translated JSON files to FutureTech by uploading them to a shared cloud storage service, which will be accessible via API.

* Ensure that the translations are accurate and consistent with the original English content.

* Test the website with the translated content and resolve any errors or issues that may arise.
