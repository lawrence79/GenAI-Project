Prompt: "write a javascript function to translate an english language JSON file into Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Chinese, Japanese and Arabic"

Answer:

Firstly, it's important to note that the translation of text is a complex task, and doing it accurately typically requires access to a high-quality translation service, such as Google Translate API, Microsoft Azure Translation Text API, Amazon Translate, etc. These services are not free, but they provide high-quality translations for many languages.

Here's a general idea of how you might set up a function to translate a JSON file using Node.js with Google Cloud Translation API. The function will load a JSON file, translate all the values, and then write the result back to a new JSON file for each language. However, keep in mind that you need to be careful when translating structured files like JSON, as some parts might not be meant to be translated (like keys, or specific values that are codes or identifiers).

```
const fs = require('fs');
const {Translate} = require('@google-cloud/translate').v2;

// Your Google Cloud Platform project ID
const projectId = 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID';

// Creates a client
const translate = new Translate({projectId});

const languages = ['es', 'fr', 'de', 'it', 'pt', 'zh', 'ja', 'ar'];

async function translateJson(filePath) {
    const data = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf-8'));

    for (const lang of languages) {
        const translatedData = await translateObject(data, lang);
        fs.writeFileSync(`${lang}_${filePath}`, JSON.stringify(translatedData, null, 2));
    }
}

async function translateObject(obj, target) {
    const translated = {};
    for (const key in obj) {
        if (typeof obj[key] === 'string') {
            const [translation] = await translate.translate(obj[key], target);
            translated[key] = translation;
        } else if (typeof obj[key] === 'object' && obj[key] !== null) {
            translated[key] = await translateObject(obj[key], target);
        } else {
            translated[key] = obj[key];
        }
    }
    return translated;
}

translateJson('yourfile.json');
```

Had to install and setup Google Translate API to work this. Once configured ran the `node ./translate-json.js` and it works well. Quite fast.
Quality will come next.

So although we used gpt-3.5 to get there we ended up using cloud compute.
